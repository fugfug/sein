Yada yada yadaâ€¦
Low Talker
Puffy Shirt
But I don't wanna be a pirate!
not that there's anything wrong with that
Yama hama, it's fright night
Can't-stand-ya!
Get out!
Double dipping
Serenity now!
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
No soup for you!
The jerk store called; they're running out of you!
It's more like a full body dry heave set to music.
A Festivus for the rest of us!
These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Hello... Newman.
What's the deal with airplane peanuts?
Feels like an Arby's night.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
What a pear-shaped loser
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
